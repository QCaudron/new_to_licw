<h1 style="font-weight: bold;" id="club-resources">Club Resources</h1>


The club has a treasure trove of resources available to members on our Groups.io and in our club Dropbox.


## The Morse Practice Page (MPP)

The [Morse Practice Page](https://longislandcw.github.io/morsebrowser/) is a great tool to practice your Morse code skills between classes. A user guide is available on the [LICW Club website](https://longislandcwclub.org/academic-downloads/).


## Student and Instructor Guide

The [LICW Club website's Academic Downloads](https://longislandcwclub.org/academic-downloads/) section contains the Student and Instructor Guide, as well as QSO protocol documents and the Morse Practice Page users guide.


## Groups.io

When you join the LICW, you will be invited to join [our Groups.io email reflector](https://groups.io/g/LongIslandCWClub/topics). This is where we send out announcements, and where you can ask questions and get help from other members.

You can set your [email preferences](https://groups.io/g/LongIslandCWClub/editsub) to receive all emails or daily summaries. 

### Announcements

Every week, Rick W8KO sends out an email with the week's schedule and any other important announcements. This will always be pinned to the top of the Groups.io, and is called **Class & Forum Schedule for next week**.

Also pinned is an email from Dave VK5PL with information on [how to join classes](https://groups.io/g/LongIslandCWClub/topic/how_to_join_classes/99048520). Here, you'll find links to the Zoom rooms for each class.


## Club Dropbox

You'll find a link to the Club Dropbox in the [pinned email from Dave VK5PL](https://groups.io/g/LongIslandCWClub/topic/how_to_join_classes/99048520) in our [Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/LongIslandCWClub/topics). Please do not share this link with non-members.

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;" id="setting-up-zoom">Setting up Zoom</h1>


We use Zoom for all of our classes. Zoom does some clever audio processing to quiet background noise, but this interferes with the Morse code you'll be sending in class. To make sure your code is heard clearly, you'll need to adjust your Zoom settings.

## Zoom settings

1. **Turn off "automatically adjust microphone volume".** Go to `Settings` > `Audio` and uncheck `Automatically adjust microphone volume`.
2. **Turn off background noise suppression.** On the same screen, set `Background noise suppression` to LOW.
3. **Turn off echo cancellation.** Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click `Advanced`, then uncheck `Echo cancellation`.
4. You may need to **turn ON "original sound for musicians".** Go to `Settings` > `Audio` > `Advanced` and check `Show in-meeting option to "Enable Original Sound" from microphone`.

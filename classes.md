## Which classes should I attend?

The LICW runs 138 classes every week for beginners, intermediate, and advanced students. You are welcome in all classes, no matter your level of proficiency. 

We suggest you find a class that suits you well in terms of level to attend regularly. We also recommend you attend a class of the next level up. Having one "comfort" class and one "stretch" class is a great way to make progress.


## What levels are each class?

- **Beginners Carousel 1 and 2** classes are for those who are just starting out with CW. Start here if you're brand new to CW. By the end of BC2, you will know all 40 characters, and have learned how to practice effectively. These classes run at 12 wpm.
- **Beginners Carousel 3** gets you on the air, with short-exchange contests like the SKCC WES, SOTA / POTA, and the LICW Challenge, at 12 wpm.
- **Intermediate** classes make you fluent in CW; we introduce conversational head-sending and slowly speed up from 12 wpm to 20 wpm, introducing head-copy as we go.
- **Advanced** classes are for those who are already fluent in CW and want to get faster. We run at speeds from 20 wpm to 40 wpm, with a focus on rag-chewing.


## Where are the classes?

Classes take place over Zoom. The club runs four Zoom rooms, imaginatively named A, B, C, and D. You can find the links to these rooms in the pinned email from Dave VK5PL in our [Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/LongIslandCWClub/topic/how_to_join_classes/99048520). Please do not share these links with non-members.


## When do classes run?

You can find [our full calendar here](https://longislandcwclub.org/events/). Each week is the same, with the same classes running at the same time every day, in the same Zoom room.


#### Beginners classes

Our Beginners Carousel classes aim to help you learn how to learn CW. We introduce three new letters each week. The first half-hour of each class is spent on these three letters, and the second half-hour brings in letters from the previous two weeks.

Every Beginners Carousel class in a given week covers the same letters. You can attend more than one per week for extra practice.


## Do classes reset? When can I start?

You can start right away. All of our classes follow a **carousel** structure, meaning they go around and around, with no start or end date. You can start at any time, and you can attend as many classes as you like before moving on to the next level.


## What should I attend first?

Every Monday, Dave VK5PL runs an **Introduction to LICW Club Resources** class in Zoom A. This is a great place to learn in more depth about the resources available to you as a member of the LICW, how to navigate the classes, and how to get the most out of your time with us.

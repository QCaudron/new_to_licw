# Classes at LICW 

## Which classes should I attend?

The LICW runs 138 classes every week, over Zoom. We have classes for beginners, intermediate, and advanced students. You are welcome in all classes, no matter your level of proficiency. We suggest you find a class that suits you well in terms of level, and attend that class whenever you can. We also recommend you attend a class of the next level up. Having one "comfort" class and one "stretch" class is a great way to make progress.


## When do classes run?

You can find [our full calendar here](https://longislandcwclub.org/events/). Each week is the same, with the same classes running at the same time every day. We have classes every day of the week, at different times to suit many parts of the world. 


### Beginners classes

Our Beginners Carousel classes aim to help you learn how to learn CW. We introduce three new letters each week. The first half-hour of each class is spent on these three letters, and the second half-hour brings in letters from the previous two weeks.

Every Beginners Carousel class in a given week covers the same letters. You can attend more than one per week for extra practice.


## Do classes reset? When can I start?

You can start right away. All of our classes follow a **carousel** structure, meaning they go around and around, with no start or end date. You can start at any time, and you can attend as many classes as you like before moving on to the next level.
